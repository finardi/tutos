        "## Libraries\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper proposes a novel method that leverages ASCII art to create adversarial prompts that by pass LLMs security guardrails. We're using the [art](https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/art?tab=readme-ov-file) python package to generate the arts, it's the same library used by the authors.\n",

        "## Results\n",
        "\n",
        "In Appendix C of the paper, the authors shows an example of a cloaked prompt using the font `block`. Although it looks pretty cool, I was not able to reproduce the attack using that font as the GPT-4 fails to identify the masked word.\n",
        "\n",
        "In fact, looking at Figure 5, we can see that the LLMs do poorly at identifing the underlying word of an ascii art for the vast majority of fonts. In fact, the few fonts where it performs well are the ones that include the letter itself.\n",

        "Some of the fonts where LLMs do well are:\n",
